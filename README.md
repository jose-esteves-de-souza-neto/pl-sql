## Exam topics

### Declaring PL/SQL Variables

- Recognize valid and invalid identifiers;
- List the uses of variables, declare and initialize variables, use bind variables;
- List and describe various data types using the %TYPE and %ROWTYPE attributes.

### Writing Executable Statements

- Construct and identify loop statements;
- Use EXIT and CONTINUE statements inside loops.

### Working with Composite Data Types

- Create user-defined PL/SQL records;
- Create a record with the %ROWTYPE attribute;
- Create an INDEX BY table and INDEX BY table of records;
- Describe the differences among records, collections, and collections of records;
- Initialize collections and records.

### Using Explicit Cursors

- Declare and use cursors with parameters;
- Lock rows with the FOR UPDATE clause and reference the current row with the WHERE CURRENT OF clause.

### Handling Exceptions

- Define PL/SQL exceptions;
- Recognize unhandled exceptions;
- Handle different types of exceptions (internally defined exceptions, predefined exceptions and user-defined exceptions);
- Propagate exceptions;

### Using PL/SQL Subprograms

- Differentiate between anonymous blocks and subprograms;
- Create a simple procedure and invoke it from an anonymous block;
- Identify benefits of subprograms.

### Creating Procedures and Using Parameters

- Create a procedure with parameterrs;
